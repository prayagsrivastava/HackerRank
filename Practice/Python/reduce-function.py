#The reduce() function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively
# on a list of objects in succession from left to right to reduce it to one value.
# Say you have a list, say [1,2,3] and you have to find its sum.
#>>> reduce(lambda x, y : x + y,[1,2,3])
#6

#You can also define an initial value.
# If it is specified, the function will assume initial value as the value given, and then reduce.
# It is equivalent to adding the initial value at the beginning of the list. For example:
#>>> reduce(lambda x, y : x + y, [1,2,3], -3)
#3

#>>> from fractions import gcd
#>>> reduce(gcd, [2,4,8], 3)
# 1
